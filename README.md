Ducttape Engine
===============
A universal open-source game engine using Ogre3D for graphics, SFML for network
and audio and Bullet for physics.

Documentation
-------------
For further instructions and developer information please browse the docs/
directory. If you have Doxygen and Graphviz, you can build the API docs by
issuing `make doc` in your CMake build dir.

Cloning
-------
If you clone this using the usual `git clone git://github.com/ducttape/ducttape-engine.git`
please run `git submodule update --init` as the first thing you do within the 
cloned repo.
Alternatively, you can just clone with `git clone --recursive git://github.com/ducttape/ducttape-engine.git`
and it will do that for you.
This will get our externals that are in different git repos to keep this one
clean and dandy.
